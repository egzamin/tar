## Test Names Should Influence Object’s API

```ruby
def test_a_new_world_is_empty
  world = World.new
  assert_equal 0, world.living_cells.count
end

def test_a_cell_can_be_added_to_the_world
  world = World.new
  world.set_living_at(1, 1)
  assert_equal 1, world.living_cells.count
end
```

Possible changes.

```ruby
def test_a_new_world_is_empty
  world = World.new
  assert_true world.empty?
end

def test_a_cell_can_be_added_to_the_world
  world = World.new
  world.set_living_at(1, 1)
  assert_true world.alive_at?(1, 1)
end

def test_after_adding_a_cell_the_world_is_not_empty
  world = World.new
  world.set_living_at(1, 1)
  assert_false world.empty?
end
```


## Duplication of Knowledge about Topology (data clump smell)

```ruby
class World
  def set_living_at(x, y)
  end
  def alive_at?(x, y)
  end
end
```

Duplication.

```ruby
class World2
  def add_living_at(location)
  end
  def alive_at?(location)
  end
end
```

```ruby
class Location
  attr_reader :x, :y
  def initialize(x, y)
    @x = x; @y = y
  end
end
```


## Breaking Abstraction Level

```ruby
def test_world_is_not_empty_after_adding_a_cell
  location = Location.new(1,1)
  world = World.empty world.set_living_at(location)

  assert_false world.empty?
end
```

Our test code is implying that the empty? method is somehow dependent on the
coordinates, themselves.

```ruby
it '(mocking location) the world with a living cell is not empty' do
  location = double('location')
  world.add_living_at(location)

  expect(world.empty?).to eq(false)
end
```

By tying this test to a concrete implementation of 2 dimensions,
via the `(1,1)` tuple, rather than the `Location` abstraction,
*we are laying the groundwork for fragile tests*:
change the topology and tons of tests fail that are not related
to the coordinate system. This *coupling* is an example of
*duplication*: spreading the knowledge of the topology not just throughout the
code, but also throughout the test suite.


## Naive Duplication

Look at the duplication of `number_of_neighbors == 3` below.

```ruby
class Cell
  attr_reader :alive # true | false
  def alive_in_next_generation?
    if alive
      neighbor_count == 2 || neighbor_count == 3
    else
      neighbor_count == 3
    end
  end
end
```

In the code below the duplication was removed.
What is wrong with the dried code.

```ruby
class Cell
  def alive_in_next_generation?
    (alive && neighbor_count == 2) || neighbor_count == 3
  end
end
```

Every piece of knowledge has one and only one representation.

The two 3s above are not the same. Why?

One useful technique to keep from mistaking similar-looking code as actual
knowledge duplication is to *explicitly name the concepts* before you try to
eliminate the duplication. For example

```ruby
class Cell
  def alive_in_next_generation?
    if alive
      # neighbor_count == 2 || neighbor_count == 3
      stable_neighborhood?
    else
      # neighbor_count == 3
      genetically_fertile_neighborhood?
    end
  end
end
```


## Procedural Polymorphism

Why is “alive” the state we are interested in? What if we add another state?

```ruby
class Cell
  def alive_in_next_generation?
    if alive
      stable_neighborhood?
    else
      genetically_fertile_neighborhood?
    end
  end
end
```

What about this code?

```ruby
class LivingCell
  def alive_in_next_generation?
    # neighbor_count == 2 || neighbor_count == 3
    stable_neighborhood?
  end
end

class DeadCell
  def alive_in_next_generation?
    # neighbor_count == 3
    genetically_fertile_neighborhood?
  end
end
```

Fixing the names to match the actual concepts. +
(Breaks polymorphism.)

```ruby
class LivingCell
  def stays_alive?
    neighbor_count == 2 || neighbor_count == 3
  end
end

class DeadCell
  def comes_to_life?
    neighbor_count == 3
  end
end
```


## Behavior Attractors

A code sample.

```ruby
class World
  def set_living_at(x, y)
  end
  def alive_at?(x, y)
  end
end

class Cell
  attr_reader :x, :y
  def alive_in_next_generation?
    # run rules
  end
end
```

For these methods, we need neighbors locations.

```ruby
def neighbors_of(x, y)
  # calculate the coordinates of neighbors
end
```

Now, an important question is: *Where do we put this method?*

Determining the right place for a new behavior can be *very* challenging.

We have the following possibilites: World (God class), Cell, Location class
It seems that is the natural behavior for Location class.

```ruby
class Location
  attr_reader :x, :y
  def neighbors
    # calculate a list of locations that are considered neighbors
  end
end
```

This is called a *behavior attractor* – a class that naturally accept
new behaviors that arise.


## Testing State vs Testing Behavior

Developing a very *state-focused* test suite.
(We are checking what, if any, state change occured.)

```ruby
def test_a_world_starts_out_empty
  world = World.new
  assert_true world.empty?
end

def test_world_is_not_empty_after_setting_a_living_cell
  world = World.new
  location = Location.random
  world.set_living_at(location)
  assert_false world.empty?
end
```

Developing code *behavior-focused* way.

> Building our system in a behavior-focused way is about only
  building the things that are absolutely needed and only at the time
  they are needed.

So, in the code above we are asking:

1. How do we know that we want to set an individual cell?
    1. Why do we need to set an individual cell?
      We might set up the initial pattern.
      (This leads to another question.)
    1. Why do we need the initial pattern?
      The point of the game is to *calculate the next generation*.
      (Identified a fundamental behavior.)
1. How do we know that we want to check that the world is empty?

```ruby
def test_a_new_world_is_empty
  assert_true World.new.empty?
end

def test_an_empty_world_stays_empty_after_a_tick
  world = World.new
  next_world = world.tick
  assert_true next_world.empty?
end
```
